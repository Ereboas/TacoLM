## Abstract
Neural codec language model (LM) has demonstrated strong capability in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, the codec LM often suffers from limitations in inference speed and stability, due to its auto-regressive nature and implicit alignment between text and audio. In this work, to handle these challenges, we introduce a new variant of neural codec LM, namely TacoLM. Specifically, TacoLM introduces a gated attention mechanism to improve the training and inference efficiency and reduce the model size. Meanwhile, an additional gated cross-attention layer is included for each decoder layer, which improves the efficiency and content accuracy of the synthesized speech. In the evaluation of the Librispeech corpus, the proposed TacoLM achieves a better word error rate, speaker similarity, and mean opinion score, with 90% fewer parameters and 5.2 times speed up, compared with VALL-E.

## Zero-Shot TTS Continutaion Samples.

We perform the zero-shot continuation task on the LibriSpeech test-clean set. For each sample, we take the first 3 seconds as the audio prompt and make it generate the original text of the sentence (as the text prompt). For the experiments of YourTTS, we had it synthesize complete sentences rather than continuing from the speech prompt. 8 samples are randomly selected and shown below.
